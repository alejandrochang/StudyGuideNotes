### What is a REST API?
REST API stands for Representational State Transfer (Application Programming Interface). Usually a REST API works the same way a website does, you make a call from a client to a server and you get data back through the HTTP protocol. 

A RESTful API is an application programming interface that uses HTTP request to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE data.
