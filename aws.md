# AWS

### High Availability and Fault Tolerant
Using AWS services allows for high avalability of whatever you put in the cloud as you only need an internet connection to access your information. In addition, it also allows for your information to be fault tolerant as it is not just connected to you hard drive but instead connected up to the cloud. 

### On-Premise vs. AWS(Scalability & Elasticity)
With On-Premise companies all their hardware/servers has to be accessable within the company. Companies will typically estimate the future use of their servers based on their users/data so that their companies can continue operating smoopthly. However, this becomes an issue as foreseeing is not always correct, which can lead to over-spending on servers that they don't need or under-spending on servers that they do need. 

With AWS services your servers can be accessed on an on-demand basis. This allows for scalability and elasticity within the company. Scalability refers to the reality that as user-base grows, you have the ability to quickly access more servers to 'scale-up' extremely easy. Elasticity refers to the fact that you can grow, but you can also shrink as needed based on your company needs.
