### Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation is the process of aplplying logical operations ona  sequence of bits to achieve a required result.

### Memoryy(Stack vs. Heap);
Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap is use for dynamic memory allocation, both stored in the computers RAM. The stacj is reserved in LIFO order, while the Heap has no direct order. You can access that memory in any given order. 

You can use the stack if you know exactly how  much data you need to allocate before compile time and its not too big. You can use heap if you don't know exactly how much data you will need at runtime or if you need to allocate a lot of data. 

The Stack is thread specific and Heap is applications specific. (Each thread will have its own independent stack, but they will share a heap).

### Recursion

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map, hash, etc)
